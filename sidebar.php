    * SIDEBARS and WAI-ARIA
    * ======================
    * Generally, sidebars contain relavant information and links to other areas of the document/other documents. So it would be a reasonable use of the 'navigation' aria tag, to help screen readers understand this content.
    * You might like to wrap your side bar content in something similar to the following:
    *
    * <div role="navigation"> ... </div>
